- The `required` attribute only works with default form actions. You'll need to
  do your own validation in the handler. Also, if you want the form's `onSubmit`
  to not reload the page then you need to invoke `preventDefault()` on the
  `onSubmit` event object. You should also explicitly define the button `type`
  attribute as well since buttons by default are `type="submit"`

  original size
